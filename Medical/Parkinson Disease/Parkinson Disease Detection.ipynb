    "# What is Parkinson Disease\n",
    "Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a nervous system disorder that affects movement. If you have seen the movie Love & other drugs then you know something about it. There are various stages in Parkinson Disease. <br>\n",
    "Stage 1: Mild symptoms that do not typically interfere with daily life, including tremors and movement issues on only one side of the body.<br>\n",
    "Stage 2: Symptoms continue to become worse with both tremors and rigidity now affecting both sides of the body. Daily tasks become challenging.<br>\n",
    "Stage 3: Loss of balance and movements with falls becoming frequent and common. The patient is still capable of (typically) living independently.<br>\n",
    "Stage 4: Symptoms become severe and constraining. The patient is unable to live alone and requires help to perform daily activities.<br>\n",
    "Stage 5: Likely impossible to walk or stand. The patient is most likely wheelchair bound and may even experience hallucinations.<br>\n",
